This project is a **cross-platform mobile application and website** that combines the interactive features of social media with a categorized review system. 
In today‚Äôs world, people often rely on bloggers and influencers for reviews, but it‚Äôs getting harder to find truly authentic opinions. We started InOne to solve this problem and empower real people to share honest experiences. InOne combines a strong, reliable review system with social media features, creating a space where users can connect, post and make better decisions based on trusted community feedback.
